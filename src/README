# C++ Order Book Aggregator

## Overview

This project is a **C++ Order Book Aggregator** that fetches order book data from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges and calculates the effective **buy and sell price** for a given target quantity.

The design follows a modular architecture using interfaces, making it easy to extend the system with additional exchanges.

⚠️ **Important**  
This repository intentionally contains **source code only**.  
Binary files (`.exe`, `.dll`, `.lib`, `.pdb`) are excluded to avoid:
- Email antivirus blocking
- ZIP extraction issues on client systems
- OS- and compiler-specific incompatibilities
